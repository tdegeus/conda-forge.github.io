*****************

Conda-forge is a community-driven effort of cross-platform packaging and as such relies on volunteers to sustain and improve.

We encourage you to contribute in any way you can and would like! You can contribute in many categories such as:

 - Contributing new packages (:ref:`dev_contribute_pkgs`)
 - Helping in updating and maintaining packages (:ref:`maintaining_pkgs`)
 - Suggesting and implementing improvements for our :ref:`infrastructure`
 - Helping to :ref:`improve_docs`


.. _improve_docs:

Improve the documentation
===========================

You can help to improve the documentation! It is version-controlled in the
`conda-forge.github.io repository
<https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io>`_ on GitHub. The source
text is stored there in `the src/ subdirectory
<https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/tree/master/src>`_ and
is formatted using Python’s `reStructuredText
<http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_ system.

You can propose quick edits directly through the GitHub website if you have
an account there — for instance, `this link
<https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/edit/master/src/user/contributing.rst>`_
will take you directly to a web-based editor for this very webpage. In
general, the file corresponding to each page in the GitHub browser has a
little pencil icon in its top-right that lets you open it up for editing.

We are glad to know that you would like to contribute. If you are new to our community, follow the steps below to make your first contribution:
