Index of CFEPs
==============

All major changes to the project should be submitted as conda-forge enhancement proposals (CFEP).
These CFEPs are similar to `Python's PEP <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/>`_ and
`IPython's IPEP <https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/IPEPs:-IPython-Enhancement-Proposals>`_ processes.

CFEPs are stored in the `cfep GitHub repository <https://github.com/conda-forge/cfep>`_.
